This example demonstrates a common error in Javascript caused by type coercion. When adding a number and a string using the + operator, Javascript converts the number to a string and concatenates the two strings. This results in unexpected behaviour that can be difficult to debug. The solution shows how to use the Number() function to explicitly convert the string to a number before performing the addition.
